# tcl-bigdigits
bigdigits reads a number entered on the command line (as a string), and outputs the same number onto the console using "big" digits, that is, digits in the style of old big 20th century line printers that used to print the job numbers and other identification in "big" digits on the cover page.

The idea for this program is taken from the book "Programming in GO"
It is an attempt to translate the GO program into tcl.
